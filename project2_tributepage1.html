        <p class="text-box" >Mother Teresa, born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, Macedonia, dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor. Her journey from a young girl in a devout Catholic family to a revered humanitarian and Nobel Peace Prize laureate is a testament to her unwavering faith, boundless compassion, and unparalleled commitment to humanity.</p>

                <h3>Early Life and Calling</h3>

                <P>Raised in a deeply religious family, Anjezë felt a strong calling to religious life at a young age. At 18, she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, where she took the name Sister Mary Teresa after Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Her journey continued to India, where she taught at St. Mary’s High School in Calcutta. However, her destiny lay beyond the convent walls.</br>In 1946, during a train ride to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling, Mother Teresa experienced what she described as a "call within a call." She felt an intense urge to leave the convent and live among the poor, to serve those who were suffering and destitute. After two years of preparation, she founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, a congregation dedicated to helping the "poorest of the poor."</p>

                <h3>Life's Work and Achievements</h3>

                <p>
                    Mother Teresa's work began in the slums of Calcutta, where she opened a school and a home for the dying destitute. Her simple acts of love and care brought dignity to those who were often shunned by society. The Missionaries of Charity grew rapidly, extending their reach to all corners of the globe. By the time of her death in 1997, the order had thousands of members operating orphanages, hospices, and charity centers worldwide.
                    
                </br>Her efforts did not go unnoticed. Mother Teresa received numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, which she accepted in the name of the poor. Despite the accolades, she remained humble, attributing all her achievements to God.</p>

                <h3>Relationship with God</h3>
                <div class="boxes">
                <p>Mother Teresa's life was a profound example of faith in action. Her relationship with God was the cornerstone of her mission. She often described herself as "a pencil in God's hand." Despite facing personal spiritual struggles and periods of doubt, which she referred to as "the dark night of the soul," her faith never wavered in her outward commitment to God's work.
                    <br>“Prayer is not asking. Prayer is putting oneself in the hands of God, at His disposition, and listening to His voice in the depth of our hearts.”<br>
                </br>Her letters, published posthumously, revealed that she experienced a deep sense of spiritual darkness and isolation, feeling at times abandoned by God. Yet, it was in these moments of inner turmoil that her faith and commitment shone the brightest. She continued her work with even greater fervor, seeing her suffering as a way to connect more deeply with those she served.</p>

                <img id="box_images" src="images\mother_teresa_with_child.jpg" alt="mother_teresa_with_child">
                <p>Mother Teresa’s uniqueness lay in her extraordinary empathy and practical spirituality. She saw Jesus in everyone she met, particularly in the poor and suffering. Her ability to transcend cultural and religious barriers and touch the hearts of people worldwide was unparalleled. Her approach was simple yet profound: small acts of love could transform the world.

                    <br>She believed in doing "small things with great love," and this philosophy permeated every aspect of her work. Her legacy lives on through the Missionaries of Charity and the countless lives she touched with her kindness and compassion. She was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016, affirming her enduring impact on the world.
